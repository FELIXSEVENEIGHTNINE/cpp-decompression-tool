This project was somewhat vibe-coded, but for the most part it was done by me.

I used Dev-C++ which uses C++ 11. I might use VSCode with a newer version of C++ to do this.

Started February 2025, finally made it working after 9 months. This most likely doesn't work as intended, so I'm putting this as v0.1.

But hey, atleast I learned about Huffman code and more about prefix code.
